1.  Don't change version number in package.json

2.  Commit changes to GitHub

3.  Use `vsce publish version_number` where version_number is new version to
    publish using ONLY the following characters: '.0123456789'

4.  Commit changes again to GitHub (version number in package.json will now
    be the correct and new version number)

Done.
